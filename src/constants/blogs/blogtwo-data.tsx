            CarbonCut today announced the launch of its CliMarTech platform, a new category at the intersection of climate, marketing and technology. Designed for enterprises, agencies and media owners, CarbonCut turns the hidden climate cost of campaigns into clear CO₂e numbers that can be tracked, calculated and offset.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The advertising industry, worth more than $800 billion globally, is estimated to contribute over a billion tonnes of CO₂e each year, mostly Scope 3 emissions spread across production, media, and digital infrastructure. With new disclosure frameworks tightening across the UK, EU and US, those emissions are moving from &quot;good to know&quot; to &quot;must disclose.&quot;
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-800 pl-6 my-12 py-4">
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 italic">
              &quot;Marketing has long measured everything except its climate cost,&quot;
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
              said Akshae Golekar, founder of CarbonCut. &quot;After seven years building high-velocity campaigns, I kept seeing the same blind spot: Scope 3 emissions scattered across studios, servers and screens with no line of sight. CarbonCut makes those emissions visible, defensible and simple to act on. Marketing should perform on two scoreboards, growth and climate. We exist to make the second as clear and accountable as the first.&quot;
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6 text-gray-900">
            How it works
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            CarbonCut ingests activity data from marketing workflows and calculates campaign-level CO₂e across digital, social, OOH, print, events and more. Results are attributed by channel and activity, creating a single source of truth for finance, sustainability and marketing teams. Residual emissions can be neutralised through a curated portfolio of independently verified projects spanning nature, energy and waste solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Each retirement generates both a certificate trail and an immutable smart-contract entry, showing what was retired, when, and against which campaign.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6 text-gray-900">
            Why it matters
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            As climate disclosure frameworks tighten across major markets, marketing emissions, largely Scope 3, are moving from &quot;nice to know&quot; to non-negotiable. CarbonCut is intentionally practical: no black-box scoring or jargon, just auditable numbers and a straight path to action. The platform slots into existing cadence: fast to adopt, clear in output and ready for internal reporting and external claims.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The intent behind CarbonCut is straightforward: accelerate the transition from &quot;marketing as usual&quot; to marketing with climate integrity. In the near term, that means giving brands a single, defensible source of truth for campaign emissions and a credible route to neutralisation. In the long term, it means net-zero advertising, an ecosystem in which every impression carries a known, minimised footprint, and every residual tonne is transparently addressed. This is how our industry can contribute, in practical terms, to the goals set for this decade.
