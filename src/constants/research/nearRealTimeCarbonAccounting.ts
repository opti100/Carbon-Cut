  abstract:
    'Digital infrastructure and internet-based services contribute an estimated 3-4% of global CO₂e emissions, a share comparable to aviation and projected to grow. Current carbon accounting practices for internet data transmission rely on annualised, batch-based estimation methods, which lack temporal granularity, omit critical components of the transmission circuit, and introduce structural bias into emissions reporting. This paper proposes and evaluates three complementary attribution methodologies designed to overcome these limitations: (1) an operational hybrid resolution method for compliance-grade reporting; (2) a hybrid deterministic-batch method for improved accuracy under real-world telemetry constraints; and (3) a fully deterministic event-level framework representing the theoretical upper bound of attribution fidelity. Using synthetic hourly datasets for 200 workloads of a representative mid-size website, built with the emission factors of a production carbon accounting platform, we show that the hybrid deterministic-batch method reduces hourly attribution error from 35% under conventional batch accounting to 5%, statistically indistinguishable from the fully deterministic benchmark, and still by more than half when only a quarter of its deterministic components are covered by telemetry. The operational hybrid method ensures complete, auditable coverage of emission sources and removes most of the annual bias of batch accounting. Our findings indicate that near-real-time carbon accounting for internet data transmission is technically feasible, significantly more accurate than current practices, and essential for supporting evolving regulatory and operational decision-making.',

Projections suggest that, in the absence of targeted methodological and operational interventions, emissions from digital infrastructure will continue to increase in both absolute and relative terms, amplifying the importance of robust carbon accounting for internet activity. Data centre electricity demand is projected to rise substantially with the expansion of AI workloads (IEA, 2025), although estimates of current and future energy use remain highly sensitive to methodological assumptions and data sources (Masanet et al., 2020; Mytton and Ashtine, 2022). Sector-specific assessments, for example of online advertising, likewise indicate a substantial but highly uncertain footprint (Pärssinen et al., 2018).',

          text: 'Despite this growing significance, emissions accounting for internet data transmission remains largely retrospective and coarse-grained, typically relying on annual or quarterly batch-based estimates derived from aggregated activity metrics and static emission factors. Published estimates of the electricity intensity of internet data transmission consequently span several orders of magnitude, largely because of differences in system boundaries, reference years and allocation methods (Coroama and Hilty, 2014; Aslan et al., 2018). Such methods fail to capture temporal variation in grid carbon intensity, dynamic changes in traffic volume and routing, and load-dependent compute efficiency, which leads to systematic misallocation and under- or over-estimation of emissions across time and services. In parallel, most existing frameworks focus on isolated subsystems such as cloud servers (e.g. Lannelongue et al., 2021) while excluding network routing, backbone transmission, CDNs, idle infrastructure capacity, and protocol or data-transfer overheads, thereby introducing structural bias into reported emissions. The effect of boundary choice is material in practice: in a production-scale measurement of AI serving, a narrow boundary covering only active accelerator energy underestimated per-request energy by a factor of 2.4 relative to a comprehensive boundary that also included host CPU and memory, idle provisioned capacity and data centre overhead (Elsworth et al., 2025).',

The core hypothesis is that attribution accuracy is fundamentally constrained by temporal resolution and system boundary completeness rather than by any single emission factor or modelling choice, and that improving these dimensions yields substantial gains even under realistic telemetry constraints.',

In relative terms, the largest reductions occur for CDN (96%), storage (88%) and compute (82%), followed by end-user devices (73%) and network transmission (69%). Because compute accounts for 82% of emissions, its reduction from 30% to 5% contributes most of the aggregate improvement. This ranking is consistent with the design logic of Method 2: compute and CDN energy use is both variable, responding to load, caching behaviour and time of day, and well observed through utilisation metrics and CDN logs, so deterministic treatment yields the largest benefit (Figure 7). Network transmission shows the smallest relative improvement because backbone and access-network energy remain allocated through proxies and daily average intensity in the absence of routing-level telemetry. Together with end-user devices, it therefore represents the main source of residual error under current data availability, and the component where improved provider transparency would most increase accuracy. The importance of components that are often omitted is supported by production measurements of AI serving, in which idle provisioned capacity and facility overhead together accounted for about 18% of per-request energy and were excluded by narrower measurement boundaries (Elsworth et al., 2025).',

Against the materiality thresholds of around 5% commonly applied in greenhouse gas verification, conventional batch accounting fails by a wide margin, whereas all three proposed methods meet the threshold for annual totals. For daily or hourly reporting, which carbon-aware operation requires, only Methods 2 and 3 approach this level of precision (daily errors of 1.2% and 1.0%, against 13.7% for Method 1).

The batch bias is driven mainly by boundary omissions and by factors that understate storage and idle energy, rather than by temporal averaging. Temporal averaging introduces a further, profile-dependent bias: because batch methods apply annual average carbon intensity, they understate emissions when demand coincides with carbon-intensive grid periods and overstate them when demand is concentrated in low-carbon periods (Miller et al., 2022). The 10% of hours with the highest grid carbon intensity hold 14.4% of emissions, so a time-invariant factor understates the emissions of these hours by about 31%. The direction of bias therefore depends on how an organisation's traffic profile aligns with grid conditions (Figure 12), which has direct implications for the credibility of reported reductions and for the design of demand-shifting strategies (Wiesner et al., 2021; Radovanović et al., 2023).",

The key test is whether the advantage of Method 2 over conventional batch accounting is preserved across plausible ranges of the parameters that most influence attributed emissions (Table 2). Published estimates of network electricity intensity, for example, vary by orders of magnitude depending on boundary and reference year (Coroama and Hilty, 2014; Aslan et al., 2018), and grid carbon intensity varies substantially by hour and region (Hawkes, 2010; Siler-Evans et al., 2012). Each parameter was set to the lower and upper ends of its range with all others held at baseline, on 100 workloads. Across the five physical parameters, the ratio of batch to Method 2 MAE remains between 6.1 and 8.4, so the advantage of the hybrid approach is not an artefact of any single physical assumption. Batch error is most sensitive to the idle capacity share (31.4-39.8%) and network intensity (32.8-45.3%), because both increase the share of energy that lies outside the batch boundary or is estimated with static factors. The assumption that materially changes the result is telemetry coverage: when only 25% of the deterministic components are covered, Method 2 MAE rises to 14.8% and the error ratio falls to 2.3, close to the approximately two-fold advantage expected under sparse telemetry.',

First, all errors are measured against a reference derived from the same synthetic data-generating process that underpins the deterministic methods; methods that share more structure with that process will tend to perform better, so the absolute error values should be read as indicators of relative performance rather than as estimates of real-world accuracy. Second, Method 3 itself shows a non-zero MAE, which implies that the reference emissions are not identical to the Method 3 formulation. The reference emissions are generated by a richer component-level model (Section 2.3) that includes an idle power floor, load-dependent protocol overhead and path-level grid intensity, and Method 3 departs from it only through the measurement error assumed for telemetry and grid-intensity signals. The absolute errors of Methods 2 and 3 are therefore set largely by these assumed error levels (Figure 14) and should not be read as achievable real-world accuracy. In addition, part of the batch error arises from platform default factors, notably a per-gigabyte storage factor that understates storage energy relative to a power-based estimate; batch accounting with better calibrated static factors would show a smaller bias, although its temporal error would remain. Third, the analysis covers a single platform architecture and traffic profile; services dominated by video streaming, large file transfer or AI inference differ in the relative weight of network and compute components, and the gains from each rung of the ladder may differ accordingly (Aslan et al., 2018; Elsworth et al., 2025). Finally, the evaluation is limited to operational electricity-related emissions and does not consider the embodied emissions of network and end-user equipment, which can be material over the life cycle of digital services (Gupta et al., 2021). Validation against metered data from a production environment, as has recently been demonstrated for AI serving (Elsworth et al., 2025), is therefore the most important next step.',
